## Structure (struct) in C
Defining user-defined data types using struct.
## Nested Structure
One structure (struct node) used as a member inside another structure (struct node1).
## Structure Member Access
Dot operator (.)
Nested access (f.e.a)
## sizeof Operator
Size of a structure
Size difference due to nesting
## Pointer-like Address Understanding
Concept of memory addresses (1000, 2000, 4000 etc.)
## Scope of Structure Variables
Difference between structure name and variable name
## Structure Declaration vs Definition
Declaring a structure
Creating structure variables
## Multiple Structures Interaction
Structure a inside structure b
## Pointer to Array Elements
Using pointer to access array values
## Array of Structures
Declaring an array of structures
(struct S1 a[ ])
## Pointer inside Structure
Structure containing a pointer member
(struct S1 *p)
## Pointer to Structure
Assigning structure array address to pointer
(struct S1 *ptr = a;)
## Pointer Arithmetic on Structure Pointer
ptr + 1 moving to next structure element
## Nested Member Access
a[0].z
ptr->z
(*ptr).z
## Memory Layout of Structures
Address mapping of structure array
## Relationship Between Array, Pointer & Structure
Array name as base address.
Pointer referencing array of structures
## Looping Through Structures
for loop used to traverse array of structures
