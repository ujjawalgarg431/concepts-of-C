# concepts-of-C

## 1.Structure (struct) in C
Defining user-defined data types using struct.
## 2.Structure
One structure (struct node) used as a member inside another structure (struct node1).
## 3.Structure Member Access
Dot operator (.)
Nested access (f.e.a)
## 4.size of Operator
Size of a structure
Size difference due to nesting
## 5.Pointer-like Address Understanding
Concept of memory addresses (1000, 2000, 4000 etc.)
## 6.Scope of Structure Variables
Difference between structure name and variable name
## 7.Structure Declaration vs Definition
Declaring a structure
Creating structure variables
## 8.Multiple Structures Interaction
Structure a inside structure b
## 9.Pointer to Array Elements
Using pointer to access array values
## 10.Array of Structures
Declaring an array of structures\
(struct S1 a[ ])
## 11.Pointer inside Structure
Structure containing a pointer member\
(struct S1 *p)
## 12.Pointer to Structure
Assigning structure array address to pointer\
(struct S1 *ptr = a;)
## 13.Pointer Arithmetic on Structure Pointer
ptr + 1 moving to next structure element
## 14.Nested Member Access
a[0].z\
ptr->z\
(*ptr).z
## 15.Memory Layout of Structures
Address mapping of structure array
## 16.Relationship Between Array, Pointer & Structure
Array name as base address\
Pointer referencing array of structures
## 17.Looping Through Structures
for loop used to traverse array of structures
## 18.Call by Value
Passing a structure variable to a function\
changes inside function do not affect original structure
## 19.Call by Reference
Passing address of structure to a function\
Changes inside function do affect original structure
## 20.Function Calls
Function with structure parameter\
Function with pointer-to-structure parameter
